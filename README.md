# Etch-a-Sketch
This project is part of the foundations course on [The Odin Project website](https://www.theodinproject.com).
It uses CSS and JavaScript to display a square grid of divs which the user can "draw" on by hovering over the divs. 
In accordance with the project specification the user can re-size the grid via a button. There's also a button for clearing the grid of any coloring.
